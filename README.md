# GCC Joke for OS Labs

Welcome to `GccJoke`! This repository is a light-hearted, educational tool designed for Operating Systems lab students. It playfully simulates a scenario where a user named 'Firas' is unable to compile C code using `gcc`.

## Features

- **GCC Script**: A script that mimics the `gcc` command, providing a humorous message instead of compiling C code.
- **Docker Setup**: Includes a Dockerfile for setting up a Debian environment where this scenario is replicated.

## Educational Purpose

- Understand basic user management in Linux.
- Learn about customizing the Bash shell environment.
- Explore Docker containerization and user-specific configurations.

## How to Use

You need to have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) installed and written in PATH for this to work.

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run using `run.sh`
3. Type the command (or copy & paste this):

   ```bash
   clear
   gcc ex1.c -o ex1
   ```

4. Explore the scripts to see how user-specific environments and commands can be manipulated in Linux.
5. If you want to change name *Firas* to something else, then don't be afraid to change NAME variable at the beginning of every script and Dockerfile.
